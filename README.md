# Deep Omics

This repository saves some examples used in the Short Course on Deep Learning in Omics, by Wei Sun and Nancy Zhang.

## Use auto-encoder to analyze somatic mutation datas

see folder somatic_mutations/msk_impact


## scRNA-seq data

see folder scRNAseq. There are two datasets:

- Allen_BI: single nucleus RNA-seq data of human brains, generated by SMART-seq2 protocol

- Zheng_2017: scRNA-seq data of human blood, generated by 10x droplet-based system. Cells of known cell types were mixed. 

- gene_annotation: gene annotation data and summary.

## Terminology

**Node/neuron**: a *computational unit* in a neural network that has one or more weighted input connections and an activation function that combines the inputs and provide an output. 

**Weights**: when input enters the neuron, it is multiplied by a weight. 

**Embedding**: low dimensional representation of a high dimensional input

**Activation function**: the output of a neuron is f(Wh + b), where h is input, W is the *weight*, b is *bias*, and f is the *activation function*.

**Perceptron**: a perceptron is a simple linear binary classifier. For example, y = 1 if WX + b > 0 and y = 0 otherwise. 

**Feedforward neural network**: a neuron network where information goes forward. 

**MLP (Multi Layer perceptron)**: in a narrow sense, it refers to multiple layers of perceptrons, but it often refers to any feedforward neural networks.
